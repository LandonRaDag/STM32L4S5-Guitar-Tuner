# STM Tuner üé∏
A real-time guitar tuner built on the STM32L4S5 microcontroller for ECSE 444 (Microprocessors) at McGill University.

## Overview
STM Tuner provides accurate, low-latency guitar tuning using a microphone input and advanced signal processing techniques.  
It supports two modes:
- **Microphone Mode**: Detects the guitar string‚Äôs pitch in real-time using a bandpass filter, RMS thresholding, Kalman filtering, and the YIN autocorrelation algorithm, enhanced by parabolic interpolation.
- **Ear Tuning Mode**: Outputs reference tones using the microcontroller‚Äôs DAC and a connected speaker.

User interaction is handled through a custom UART-based Python terminal, offering dynamic tuning feedback.

## Key Features
- **Microphone Pitch Detection** (optimized for EADGBE standard tuning)
- **Ear Tuning Mode** (reference tones generated in real-time)
- **Low-latency DMA-based audio capture**
- **Custom Python Serial UI** for interactive feedback
- **Signal Processing Pipeline** (High-pass filter, Band-pass filter, Kalman smoothing, Clipping limiter)
- **YIN Autocorrelation + Parabolic Interpolation** for high-precision frequency estimation

## Technologies
- STM32 HAL libraries (DFSDM, DAC, UART, DMA)
- Python (serial communication for terminal interface)
- Signal Processing Techniques (bandpass filters, Kalman filter, YIN algorithm)

## Challenges Overcome
- Designed around buffer and sampling constraints for real-time detection
- Switched from FFT-based pitch detection to YIN algorithm for higher accuracy at lower latency
- Developed a user-friendly terminal for easier guitar tuning in noisy environments

## Future Improvements
- Add automatic string detection
- Support chromatic tuning modes
- Package as standalone device with integrated display
